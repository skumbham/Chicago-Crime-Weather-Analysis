# Chicago Crime and Weather Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the correlation between weather conditions and crime rates in Chicago. Using Apache PySpark, we process large datasets containing detailed records of crimes and weather conditions, perform data cleaning, and integrate these datasets to explore potential patterns.
